LOS ANGELES &mdash; A common criticism of the video game industry is that its productions usually shy away from real world politics, be it by fear of storytelling getting in the way of gameplay or because it might alienate part of their audience. This year's edition of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), which took place last week at the Los Angeles Convention Center, might just be a sign of things moving forward, with the likes of *Cyberpunk 2077* and the post-Brexit dystopia *Watch Dogs: Legion* stealing the show.

But while early testers have lamented *Watch Dogs*' focus on romanticized mass surveillance, the most overlooked piece of commentary might come from Japanese developer Game Freak, which presented E3 audiences with a playable build of its upcoming Nintendo Switch title.

"*Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* are set in the fictional Galar region, which is obviously based on the UK", said game director Shigeru Ohmori during a Q&A session following Nintendo's presentation. Speaking through a translator, he added: "The Pokémon series is all about forging bonds, and how we can be stronger together. We thought the current political turmoil could put those values at risk, and it turned out to be a great starting point for the player's adventure."

Despite warm reactions to the demo from E3 attendees and online audiences, the games drew controversy when Game Freak revealed that they would only allow a limited number of creatures from previous entries to be brought over to Galar &ndash; a departure from the studio's traditional "catch 'em all" policy. When asked how this decision came about, Ohmori dismissed any technical difficulties. "Galar cultivates this idea of grandeur, and in some ways it has set itself apart from other regions. We wanted the player to see both sides of the equation, and that means trainers from abroad cannot always bring their Pokémon with them," he explained. "We also considered how a no-deal situation might affect Pokémon trading. We have this constant back-and-forth between the story and gameplay teams, to figure out what's fun and how fans might react."

The change is sure to keep fans talking this year, as a movement to bring back the full roster has gained significant traction last week under the *#BringBackNationalDex* banner &ndash; but that may well be Ohmori's intention. *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* are set to release on Nintendo Switch on November 15.
